        This is an example of a payoff table and how you should interpret it:
    </p>
    <p><i>
        The rows are your actions and the columns are your opponents' actions.
        So if you chose "{{session.strat_labels.cooperate}}" and your opponent chose "{{session.strat_labels.defect}}",
        you'd get {{session.payoff_matrix.I_coop_t}} and your opponent would get {{session.payoff_matrix.I_def_t}}. <br>

        The intuition behind this is that any investment goes into a common pool like funding for a public good.
        Since we can't provide you with a public good in the game, we will increase the points in the common pool.
        To be exact, we will add 20 points for every 100 points that are invested into the common pool. <br>

        Since the pool is common, half of the points in the pool go to you, the other half to your opponent.
        So anything you invest will generate a bonus, but then again, half of your investment plus bonus
        will go to your opponent.<br>

        Unlike before, if you choose not to invest, you will pay a tax. The tax takes half of your points
        and gives them to your opponent. Of course this tax also exists for your opponent.
