    <p>
        In this study, you will be randomly and anonymously paired with another
        participant.
        Each of you simultaneously and privately chooses between two actions. Action A or B.
        Your payoffs will be determined as is described by the table in the game.
        An example as to how to interpret the table is given below.
        You will play this "game" repeatedly for at least 5 rounds.
        Afterwards there is a {{session.cont_prob_percent}} % chance that the game will end every round.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is an example of a payoff table and how you should interpret it:
    </p>
    <p><i>
        In each cell you get the payoff that is written.
        The rows are your actions and the columns are your opponents actions.
        So if you chose A and your opponent chose B, you'd get {{C.PAYOFF_D}}.
        The game is symmetric. This means your opponent is presented with an identical payoff table.
