        This is an example of a payoff table and how you should interpret it:
    </p>
    <p><i>
        In the game you get an initial amount of {{session.z}} points
        and you will be able to choose between <b>investing</b> and <b>not investing</b>.<br>

        The rows are your actions and the columns are your opponents' actions.
        So if you chose "{{session.strat_labels.cooperate}}" and your opponent chose "{{session.strat_labels.defect}}",
        you'd get {{session.payoff_matrix.I_coop}} and your opponent would get {{session.payoff_matrix.I_def}}. <br>

        The intuition behind this is that any investment goes into a common pool like funding for a public good.
        Since we can't provide you with a public good in the game, we will increase the points in the common pool.
        To be exact, we will add 30 points for every 100 points that are invested into the common pool.
        <br>

        Since the pool is common, half of the points in the pool go to you, the other half to your opponent.
        So anything you invest will generate a reward, but then again, half of your investment plus reward
        will go to your opponent.
        <br>

        If you choose not to invest, you get to keep your initial endowment
        plus half of the investment from your opponent and his reward.
