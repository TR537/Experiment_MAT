    <p>
        In this study, you will be randomly and anonymously paired with another
        participant.
        Each of you simultaneously and privately chooses between two actions. Action A or B.
        Your payoffs will be determined by the choices of both as below:
    </p>

    <p><i>
        In each cell you get the payoff that is written.
        The rows are your actions and the columns are your opponents actions.
        So if you chose A and your opponent chose B, you'd get {{C.payoff_Icoop}}.
        The game is symmetric. This means your opponent is presented with an identical payoff table.
