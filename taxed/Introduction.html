        You have played 5 rounds of the public good game. <b>From now on there will be a {{session.cont_prob_percent}}% chance
        that the game will continue for one more round</b>. This is true for every round.
    </p>

    {{if participant.treatment}}
    <p>
        The payoffs have changed. This is because now the game has a <b>tax</b>.<br>

        If someone chooses <b>{{session.strat_labels.defect}}</b>, the person pays a tax.<br>

        This is similar to a tax to provide a public good.
        You will find that only <b>investing</b> is now a profitable option, independent of your opponents' action.<br>

        Please look at the payoff table below to see the change in payoffs and how exactly the tax works.
