        The payoffs have changed. This is because now the game has a <b>tax</b>.<br>

        If someone chooses <b>{{session.strat_labels.defect}}</b>, the person pays a tax.<br>

        This is similar to a tax to provide a public good.

        Please look at the payoff table below to see the change in payoffs and how exactly the tax works.
