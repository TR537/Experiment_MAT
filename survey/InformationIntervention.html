            You have just played a game where the first five rounds were an instance of a <b>public goods</b> game.
            <p>The latter five rounds were actually the same game with a small alternation. The action B was punished and
            action A was rewarded.</p>
        {{ else }}
            <p>You have just played a game that was an instance of a <b>public goods</b> game.</p>
        {{ endif }}

        A public good is a good that everybody is using (regardless of their actions) and where it is profitable for everyone to contribute
        a little bit in order for everybody to profit from the investment. A common example would be public defence.
        You are automatically consuming it, since you are protected by the army of your country
        and you are contributing towards it through taxation. Other examples are environmental policies
        (e.g. climate change mitigation, water pollution restrictions), infrastructure (e.g. public roads),
        or primary education.

    <p>
        A common problem associated with public goods are <b>free-riders</b>.
        For example, if one person decides not to pay their taxes,
        the person still profits from everybody else financing public defence.
        Therefore, this individual is free-riding on the investment of everybody else. If everbody behaves like that
        no public good will be financed. In the public good game you played, action A corresponded to investing in a
        public good (if both invested the mutual payoffs were highest), and option B meant not to invest.
        In such models of public goods most do not manage to coordinate towards the mutually beneficial outcome
        of both players choosing A. In the long run many end up consistently playing B, which yields lower payoffs for both.
        The reason being that choosing B will always give you individually a higher payoff and if you played A,
        there was a chance of you being taken advantage of by the other player.

     <p>
         In the real world, it is not easy to make people invest into public goods either. But one possible solution
         would be the implementation of a subsidy on investing into a public good or taxing people who do not invest.
         This approach is regarded as very effective and maybe the best solution to the free-riding problem by most economists.
