            <b>Your answers are correct.</b>
            <p>
            Here are some explanations for why they were correct.
            Please read them. You can then go to the next page.
            </p>

            <p> <b> Question 1 </b> </p>
            <p> The first answer is wrong because people tend to underprovide a public good.
                The third answer is wrong because a public good is generally automatically consumed
                (e.g. public defence is always consumed by any resident). The second statement is correct
                since this is the free-riding problem that was discussed in the text. I.e. people get a benefit from
                other people investing regardless of their own contribution.
            </p>
            <p> <b> Question 2 </b> </p>
            <p> The first answer is wrong because healthcare can be privately organized.
                For example, the US has a private healthcare system. Public health on the other hand is a public good
                since every citizen profits from a higher health standard in a nation. The third statement is also wrong
                since cars can be privately owned and they only provide use to the owner.
                Environmental Policies on the other hand are useful to everybody that would be affected
                from the consequences of not having them in place.
                For example, if there was a world-wide subsidy to use green energy,
                everybody would profit from less green-house-gas emissions. Therefore, the second statement is correct.
            </p>
            <p> <b> Question 3 </b> </p>
            <p> The second answer is wrong. While putting people into jail who do not contribute might be very effective,
                it would also be very difficult to implement in any democratic state.
                The third answer is also wrong since even the more conservative anti-tax economists agree
                that in public goods markets there is a market-failure that has to be corrected through the use of a tax
                or a subsidy (from an economic standpoint subsidies and taxes are equivalent instruments).
                Therefore, taxation is currently the best option to make people provide public goods.
