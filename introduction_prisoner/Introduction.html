    <p>
        You have just read a text about public goods and taxation. Now you are going to play a game that resembles a public good market. <br>
        You will be paired with another person to play this game. The points that you collect in the game will determine your bonus payment.
        A point in the game will yield 0.1 Cents of bonus payment, and you will be playing the game for multiple rounds and the points add up over rounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Below is a sample screen with an explanation as to how you can understand the payoffs in the table.<br>
        Please read it through now, so you don't have to read through it during the game as <b>time will be limited</b>.<br>
        Your opponent needs to wait for you if you have to read the instructions again.
        Both of you will earn the bonus quickest if you understand the game now and then start playing.<br>
        In order to not let anyone wait for too long, there will be a timer on the top of every decision page for {{session.min_time}} seconds.
        This should be much more time than you would need to make a decision, and it will help not to let the other person wait for too long.<br>
        Should you fail to respond within {{session.min_time}} seconds twice, a bot will take over for you to allow the other person
        to play the game until the end. This would result in you dropping out of the study.
