        In this text I would like you to learn about public goods and how your taxes pay for them.
    </p>

    <p>
        Goods and Services can generally be split into private and public goods. <br>
        Private goods are what you would  normally think of as goods.
        You can purchase a private good and if you own one itme, nobody else can use it or own it at the same time.
        Common examples are cars, or dishes of food. <br>
        <b>Public goods</b> are different. They are usually free to use and if you use it, someone else can use it alongside you.
        Common examples are <b>national defense</b>, a <b>public drinking fountain</b>, or the <b>environment</b>.
    </p>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ static 'information/fig1.png' }}" alt="fig1"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        But if public goods are free to use, who pays for providing them?<br>
        This happens through a group effort. If everybody contributes a little bit,
        then there is enough funding to provide a public good.
        Typically, modern democracies use <b>taxes</b> to fund public goods.
    </p>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ static 'information/fig2.png' }}" alt="fig2"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        The problem is that if one person decides not to pay their contribution, they will still profit from the public good
        as it would be impossible (or extremely expensive) to exclude this person from consuming the public good. <br>
        Imagine trying to let someone not enjoy the outdoors if they don't pay their taxes. This would be almost impossible. <br>
        Such a person is called a <b>free-rider</b>.
    </p>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ static 'information/fig3.png' }}" alt="fig3"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        Some goods cannot be provided by a government. For example, the environment is a natural public good.
        It exists without a government to provide it. <br>
        Nonetheless, the government plays an increasingly important role in <b>protecting it</b>.
        You can think of it like this: <br>
        If everybody takes care of the environment a little bit (i.e. everyone recycles, uses less fossil fuels etc.)
        then the environment is safe.
    </p>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ static 'information/fig4.png' }}" alt="fig4"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        This is exactly like financing a public good because everybody makes their small contribution towards a greater goal. <br>
        But it is very hard for an individual to know how much of a contribution is enough and then there's the free rider problem again.
        If you take your bicycle to work, your neighbor could keep using her sports car to drive to work.
        Your neighbor would still profit from you (and everyone else) protecting the environment while enjoying her car.
    </p>

    <div>
        <img src="{{ static 'information/fig5.png' }}" alt="fig5"/>
    </div>

    <p>
        In order to make it <b>fair for everybody</b> and ensure <b>sufficient levels</b> of environmental protection,
        governments step in. <br>
        They use <b>taxes</b> to make environmentally damaging products more expensive.
        For example, by invoking a tax on fossil fuels, people overall consume less of it.
